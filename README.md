### Summary:
##### As we can see that about 51% of the reviews in the dataset were 5 stars reviews verses non-Vine reviews which is only 39%. This indicates a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program.
##### We can also perform the statistical distribution of the star rating for the Vine and non-Vine reviews
